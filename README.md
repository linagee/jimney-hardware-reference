===========================

Fork of pinoccio. Smaller, lighter, (faster?)

Contained are the schematics, board layout, data sheets, and BOM for the Jimney board.

The board revisions are also marked as tags in the git repository, if you'd like to see a previous version.

This is in Alpha right now, please don't produce any boards until you see this message go away.
